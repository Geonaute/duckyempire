# duckyempire
USB Rubber Ducky payload based on Empire Framework for Red Team engagements only

A ducky payload that attempts to spawn an Empire agent directly with Admin privileges. Tested in Windows 7 & 10, should works fine even on slow PCs.

Generate the Powershell callback code with Empire Framework. Switch Base64 to "False" to decrease execution time.
